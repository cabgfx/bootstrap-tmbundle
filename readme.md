# Twitter Bootstrap bundle for TextMate

Very alpha :)

At the moment, only the following snippets are available in HTML or JS flavored files (eg. Rails templates).

(scope selector: `text.html, source.js`)

* Modal box
* Accordion 
* Accordion group

When using the accordion snippets, you can tab through attributes and quickly fill in everything without missing a spot.

It is currently targeting [Bootstrap 2](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap).
